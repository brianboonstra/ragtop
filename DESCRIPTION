Description: Algorithms to price American and European
    equity options, convertible bonds and a
    variety of other financial derivatives. It uses an
    extension of the usual Black-Scholes model in which
    jump to default may occur at a probability specified
    by a power-law link between stock price and hazard
    rate as found in the paper by Takahashi, Kobayashi,
    and Nakagawa (2001) <doi:10.3905/jfi.2001.31930>.  We
    use ideas and techniques from Andersen and
    Buffum (2002) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.355308> and
    Linetsky (2006) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9965.2006.00271.x>.
