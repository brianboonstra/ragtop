\arguments{
\item{variance_instruments}{A list of instruments in strictly increasing order
of maturity, from which the volatility term structure will be inferred.  Once the
calibration is finished, the chosen parameters will reproduce the prices of
these instruments with fairly high precision.}

\item{variance_instrument_prices}{Central price targets for the variance instruments}

\item{variance_instrument_spreads}{Bid-offer spreads used to normalize errors
in variance instrument prices during term structure fitting}

\item{fit_instruments}{A list of instruments in any order, from which the
mispricing penalties used for judging fit quality will be computed}

\item{fit_instrument_prices}{Central price targets for the variance instruments}

\item{fit_instrument_spreads}{Bid-offer spreads used to normalize errors
in fit instrument prices during default intensity}

\item{fit_instrument_weights}{Weights applied to relative errors in fit
instrument prices before summing to form the penalty}

\item{S0}{Current underlying price}

\item{num_time_steps}{Time step count passed on to \code{\link{find_present_value}}
while fitting instrument values}

\item{const_short_rate}{A constant to use for the instantaneous interest rate in case \code{discount_factor_fcn}
is not given}

\item{discount_factor_fcn}{A function for computing present values to
time \code{t} of various cashflows occurring during this timestep, with
arguments \code{T}, \code{t}}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{\link{penalty_with_intensity_link}}}

\item{base_default_intensity}{Overall default intensity (in natural units)}

\item{relative_spread_tolerance}{Tolerance to apply in
calling \code{\link{fit_variance_cumulation}}}

\item{num_variance_time_steps}{Number of time steps to use in
calling \code{\link{fit_variance_cumulation}}}
}
\description{
Given derivative instruments (subclasses of
  GridPricedInstrument, though typically either \code{\link{AmericanOption}}
  or \code{\link{EuropeanOption}} objects), along with their prices and spreads, calibrate
  variance cumulation (the
 at-the-money volatility of the continuous process) and equity linked default
 intensity of the form $h(s + (1-s)(S0/S_t)^p)$.
}
\details{
In its present form, this function uses a brain-dead grid search.
