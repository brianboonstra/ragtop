    abstract = {We propose a dynamically consistent framework that allows joint valuation and estimation of stock options and credit default swaps written on the same reference company. We model default as controlled by a Poisson process with a stochastic default arrival rate. When default occurs, the stock price drops to zero. Prior to default, the stock price follows a continuous process with stochastic volatility. The instantaneous default rate and instantaneous diffusion variance rate follow a bivariate continuous Markov process, with its dynamics specified to capture the empirical evidence on stock option prices and credit default swap spreads. Under this joint specification, we derive tractable pricing solutions for stock options and credit default swaps. We estimate the joint dynamics using stock option prices and credit default swap spreads for four of the most actively traded reference companies. The estimation highlights the interaction between market risk (diffusion variance) and credit risk (default arrival) in pricing stock options and credit default swaps. While the credit risk factor dominates credit spreads at long maturities, the stock return volatility also enters credit spreads at short maturities due to positive co-movements between the diffusion variance rate and the default arrival rate. Furthermore, while the diffusion variance rate influences the implied volatility uniformly across moneyness, the impact of the credit risk factor becomes much larger on options at lower strikes. The impact of the credit risk factor on stock options also increases with option maturity. For options maturing in six months, the contribution of the credit risk factor to option pricing is comparable in magnitude to the contribution of the diffusion variance rate.},

    abstract = {We propose a model which can be jointly calibrated to the corporate bond term structure and equity option volatility surface of the same company. Our purpose is to obtain explicit bond and equity option pricing formulas that can be calibrated to find a risk neutral model that matches a set of observed market prices. This risk neutral model can then be used to price more exotic, illiquid, or over-the-counter derivatives. We observe that our model matches the equity option implied volatility surface well since we properly account for the default risk in the implied volatility surface. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for the default risk and stochastic interest rate in equity option pricing by comparing our results to Fouque et al., which only accounts for stochastic volatility.},

    abstract = {{<P>This book is designed as a text for graduate courses in stochastic processes. It is written for readers familiar with measure-theoretic probability and discrete-time processes who wish to explore stochastic processes in continuous time. The vehicle chosen for this exposition is Brownian motion, which is presented as the canonical example of both a martingale and a Markov process with continuous paths. In this context, the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic calculus is developed. The power of this calculus is illustrated by results concerning representations of martingales and change of measure on Wiener space, and these in turn permit a presentation of recent advances in financial economics (option pricing and consumption/investment optimization). </P> <P>This book contains a detailed discussion of weak and strong solutions of stochastic differential equations and a study of local time for semimartingales, with special emphasis on the theory of Brownian local time. The text is complemented by a large number of problems and exercises.</P>}},

@inbook{Eg11,
    abstract = {The calculation of the fair value and the sensitivity parameters of a financial derivative requires special numerical methods, which are often computationally very demanding. In this chapter we discuss the design and implementation of efficient {GPU} solvers for the partial differential equations ({PDEs}) of derivative pricing problems.

For derivatives on a single asset like a stock or an index we consider a massively parallel {PDE} solver which simultaneously prices a large collection of similar or related derivatives with finite difference schemes. We achieve a speedup of a factor of 25 on a single {GPU} and up to a factor of 40 on a dual {GPU} configuration against an optimized {CPU} version.

Often derivatives are written on multiple underlying assets, e.g., baskets, or the future asset price evolution is modeled with additional risk factors, like for instance stochastic volatilities. The resulting {PDE} is defined on a multidimensional state space. For these kinds of derivatives it is not necessary to pool multiple pricing calculations: alternating direction implicit ({ADI}) schemes for {PDEs} on two or more state variables have enough parallelism for an efficient {GPU} implementation. We benchmark a specific {ADI} solver for the Heston stochastic volatility model against a fully multithreaded and optimized {CPU} implementation. On a recent C2050 Fermi {GPU} we attain a speedup of a factor of 70 and more for a sufficiently large problem size.

Our results demonstrate the importance of the effective use of {GPU} resources such as fast on-chip memory and registers.},
